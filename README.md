Hi! This is my first web scraper and the first software I've tried to roll out to a general audience. It saves all the activities of a given Quotev.com account, and runs on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

Only the post text, date, and number of likes are saved. Replies are not. At the moment, it's limited to public activities only, which means it can't reach anything marked for "people you follow" or posted more than a year ago. I hope to add a password input for full functionality soon.

How to use (until I figure out how to make an executable):
 - Download qscraper.py.
 - Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you saved the script. (e.g. "cd Downloads")
 - Enter "python qscraper.py" without quotes. Windows might make you install Python.
 - Follow the instructions. When it finishes scraping, it should output the date of your first post.
 - Look in the same folder as the script for a text file called \<your URL>_activity.txt.
